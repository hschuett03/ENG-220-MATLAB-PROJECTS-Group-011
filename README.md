# ENG-220-MATLAB-PROJECTS-Group-011

  We uplpoaded 9a, 9b, final scores excel and read excel files to MatLab. We then used the read excel file to produce graphs
that create data representations of the excel file. We then edited the excel file to only have the final scores in column 1. To 
create representations of this file, we edited the 9b file to only assess column 1.
